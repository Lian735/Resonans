# Resonans

Resonans is an iOS app for turning your favorite videos into high-quality audio files. Built with SwiftUI, it focuses on a tactile, joyful experience while staying fast enough for everyday use. Whether you want to save a song from a clip, capture dialogue for a podcast, or archive audio snippets for inspiration, Resonans keeps the workflow clean and delightful.

## Features
- **Video-to-audio conversion** – Extract the soundtrack from any video you pick from the Photos library or the Files app.
- **Multiple audio formats** – Convert to M4A, WAV, or MP3, with progress feedback powered by LAME under the hood.
- **Live gallery previews** – Browse your recent clips with inline video previews and rich, animated thumbnails.
- **Personalized experience** – Switch between light, dark, and system appearances, choose your accent color, and fine-tune haptics and sound effects.
- **Performance-minded utilities** – Manage cache storage with a single tap and keep experimental features separated until you are ready to try them.

2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Lian735/Resonans.git`.
3. Open `Resonans.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
4. Let Swift Package Manager resolve dependencies (including `LAME-xcframework`).
